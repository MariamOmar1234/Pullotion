<h2 style="color: #3E60C1; font-family: cursive;">What is Pullotion?</h2>
<h3 style="color: #BE375B; text-align: left; font-family: cursive;">Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</h3>

 <h2 style="color: #3E60C1; font-family: cursive;">Types of Pollution: </h2>
  
<h3 style="color: #5F236B; text-align: left; font-family: cursive;">air pollution: Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution.<br><br> light pollution: Light pollution, or artificial light at night, is the excessive or poor use of artificial outdoor light, and it disrupts the natural patterns of wildlife, contributes to the increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, disrupts human sleep, and obscures the stars in the night sky.<br><br>noise pollution: Noise pollution, or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise or sound with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of which are harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems. the World Health Organization defines noise above 65 decibels (dB) as noise pollution. To be precise, noise becomes harmful when it exceeds 75 decibels (dB) and is painful above 120 dB<br><br> plastic pollution: Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles (e.g. plastic bottles, bags and microbeads) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat.<br><br> soil contamination: Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. any substance in the soil that exceeds naturally-occurring levels poses human health risks<br><br> radioactive contamination: Radioactive contamination, also called radiological pollution, is the deposition of, or presence of radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids, liquids, or gases. Radioactive contamination occurs when radioactive material is deposited on or in an object or a person. Radioactive materials released into the environment can cause air, water, surfaces, soil, plants, buildings, people, or animals to become contaminated.<br><br>thermal pollution:  Thermal pollution, sometimes called "thermal enrichment", is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. Thermal pollution is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence<br><br>water pollution:  Water pollution is the contamination of water sources by substances which make the water unusable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming, and other activities. Pollutants include chemicals, trash, bacteria, and parasites. All forms of pollution eventually make their way to water<br><br>Electromagnetic Pullotion: Electromagnetic interference (EMI) in electronic devices is considered as electromagnetic pollution and can have harmful effects on human health and surrounding environments in the absence of any shielding [150]. High-performance EMI shielding materials are generally employed to deal with radiation pollution

  <h2 style="color: #3E60C1; font-family: cursive;">How can we stop pollution?</h2>
<h3 style="color: #5F236B; text-align: left; font-family: cursive;">We can reduce pollution, although it might be difficult but it is definetly worth it! 

<p style="color: #5F236B">
 We can Use public transports to reduce the usage of many cars that cause air pollution.
we must Turn off the lights when we don't need them.
we should recycle and re-use used items specially plastic and if possible we can avoid using plastic as it pollouts the oceans  
we must try to stop of forest fires and smoking. we can use fans instead of Air Conditioners and use filters for chimneys
